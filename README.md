# OpenVINO Containers for XiIoT Applications

Included in this repository are docker files for generating barebone OpenVINO containers to host applications for use in Nutanix XiIoT.

Those applications may perform AI inference via OpenVINO on Intel CPU.

Also included is a sample configuration file (.yaml) for use in XiIoT to direct deployment of the containerized applications to edge endpoints.
